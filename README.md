## Requirements
[YouTube Data V3 API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)  
[64-bit VLC Media Player](https://get.videolan.org/vlc/3.0.8/win64/vlc-3.0.8-win64.exe)  
[64-bit Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe)  

### Note
This project has only been tested on Windows 10.  

## Installation

`pip install git+https://github.com/hillt03/VLCYT`

## Usage

Be sure to include quotes around arguments.

`python -m vlcyt ["<youtube_playlist_url>" -a "<YouTube V3 API Key>" -v "<VLC Install directory>" ]`


If you have VLC installed and get a FileNotFound Error, use the `-v` switch to include the path to your VLC install directory. Otherwise, don't forget to install VLC (64-bit). VLCYT will look for VLC in `C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC` by default.

After running for the first time, you can then simply enter `python -m vlcyt` and the last playlist you passed in will begin playing.  
VLCYT user data (playlist url, API key, and VLC directory) is stored in %APPDATA%\Local\VLCYT.

### Example

`python -m vlcyt "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrN6Kz2XbU&list=PLPVigFOpn3YjTdJ3-hIILmeP3jsjXntOU&index=1" -a "EXAMPLEAPIKEY" -v "C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC"`

After this initial command, do the following to load your stored settings:
`python -m vlcyt`
